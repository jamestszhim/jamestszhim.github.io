About Me
======

I am currently a Lecturer at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

My research focuses on data-centric AI, particularly on automated data augmentation methods for machine learning and artificial intelligence in low-data regimes. He is also interested in developing innovative, data-efficient solutions that enhance the performance and scalability of AI systems.
