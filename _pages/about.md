About Me
======

I am a PhD Graduate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung). My research mainly focuses on deep learning, AutoML and data augmentation for big data. I study the automation of adaptive data augmentation for modality-agnoistic data and data-centric AI frameworks. I am also interested in representation learning, such as self-supervised learning and contrastive learning.

I received my BEng degree in Computer Science and BBA degree in General Business Management from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
