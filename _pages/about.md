About Me
======

I am currently a PhD student at the CSE Department in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung). My research mainly focuses on deep learning, AutoML and data augmentation for big data. I study the automation of adaptive data augmentation for modality-agnoistic data. I am also interested in representation learning, such as self-supervised learning and contrastive learning.

I received my BEng degree in Computer Science and BBA degree in General Business Management from HKUST. Before joining HKUST as a graduate student, I worked at IBM Hong Kong as a technology analyst.
